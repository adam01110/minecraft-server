# VeinMiner supports 3 different types of storage (SQLite is used by default)
#   JSON: Each player's data is stored in its own JSON file under the specified directory. Creates lots of files, is very messy, and is generally discouraged.
#   SQLite: Player data is stored in an SQLite database table. A flat file database. Generally faster and more compact than JSON.
#   MySQL: Player data is stored remotely in a MySQL-compliant database (MySQL, MariaDB, etc.). Use this if you want to share VeinMiner data on multiple servers and have a MySQL server available to use.
Storage:
  # Can be either "JSON", "SQLite", or "MySQL"
